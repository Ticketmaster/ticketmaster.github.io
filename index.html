  <h1>Welcome to the official home for our Open Source projects</h1>
  <p>Ticketmaster/LNE is powered by Open Source software. We're committed to giving back to the FOSS community, and we've chosen <a href="//github.com/Ticketmaster">GitHub</a> in order to make collaborating on projects as simple as possible.</p>
<!--
  <p><a href="//github.com/Ticketmaster/metrilyx-2.0" class="repo">Metrilyx</a> is a dashboard UI for the amazing <a href="http://opentsdb.net/">OpenTSDB</a>, a time series database which can be used to store huge numbers of host and application metrics.  Metrilyx provides a fully-customizable interface for browsing and searching your data, with a focus on creating reusable containers for grouping.  Dashboards can be linked for drill-down, graphs can be zoomed and data exported.  Dashboards are stored as JSON and can be edited within the browser.</p>
-->
  <p><a href="//github.com/Ticketmaster/spine" class="repo">Spine</a> is a configuration framework for managing large numbers of Redhat Linux based systems (though it should be fairly easy to extend to any UNIX). written in Perl.  Spine is the system Ticketmaster uses to manage its growing infrastructure of 10,000+ systems.  It scales well due to it's flexible layout, inheritance and template interpolation (which can leverage the excellent <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>).  Plugins can be written to gather/provide extra data, configure additional systems, and more.</p>

  <p><a href="//github.com/Ticketmaster/onall" class="repo">Onall</a> is a tool to help admin large numbers of systems. Onall allows hostnames to be piped into STDIN and commands to be run (via ssh) on all piped systems in parallel. Command line options allow configuring the number of sequential hosts, the timeout and time between batches.</p>

  <p>Other projects and code snippets are available in our <a href="//github.com/Ticketmaster/" class="repo">GitHub repositories</a>.</p>
